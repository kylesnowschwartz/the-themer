# Semantic overrides -- colors used for UI concepts that don't map 1:1 to ANSI slots.
# Note: accent (#00d4ff) is a brighter cyan than ANSI cyan (#6bb6d6).
# Note: error uses the ANSI "red" value (#A167A5) for ghostty/starship;
#       neovim uses a different error color (#ff6b8a) handled in Phase 4.
